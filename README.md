What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
    I learned a lot about using HTML and CSS as a programming language. When it comes to HTML, 
I learned about its attributes, elements, inline elements, and anchor tags. On the other hand, 
in CSS, I learned more about the flexbox since it's what I used the most when making the website.
